                <li>Long wait time at airports for COVID-19 test results is one of the main concerns of international travellers arriving in India as fresh rules kick in from today in the midst of a global scare over Omicron, a new coronavirus variant. In Chennai, passengers have an option to get rapid PCR results in 30 minutes for ₹ 3,400. RT-PCR tests, which are deemed more reliable by experts, take five to six hours and are much cheaper at the price of ₹ 700. Travellers can pick any of the two tests. Domestic passengers also have to fill up forms with details about where they are going in Tamil Nadu, which would help in contact-tracing later, if needed.</li>
